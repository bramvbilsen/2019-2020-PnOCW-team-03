# Schedule

30/9: Getting to know our group. First hands on js, node.js, socket.io, back end and front end first setup.

5/10: Getting to know js. and sort our project's branches 

6/10: Getting familiar with image recognition algorithms + analyse given code from professor.

7/10: Continue working in group during our given hours: 14h-19h. Mostly writing and debating around coding the image recognition algorithm. NN or not? Matlab? Implement camera access+upload img to backend and list of users connected to the website.

10/10: Meet and continue working on image processing + display arrows on slaves.

12/10+13/10: Write and test image recognition code with server side of things. Aka recognising different colours on our screens that are connected to our server. Making sure image upload to the server is working. 

14/10:  Continue with task 3 and further complete the algorithm which TC2 and the code reviewer started last meeting on 10/10. Getting something that works even when shading and different lightnings are being used.

17/10: Learning how to isolate a screen and detect its position

21/10: have the isolation algorithm+corner detection+edge detection algorithm for assembly. Getting the paper worked on to complete our explanation behind all algorithms. Try to get an orientation detection  algorithm in there.
