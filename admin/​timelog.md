TC1: 2h

CEO: 2h



##### 7/10:

###### -Made a connection between users and server, identifying each and every user using socket.io. 

###### -Accessed a user's camera and was able to capture the videoframe and uploading it to our backend.

All: 5hours



##### 10/10:

###### -CT2 & code reviewer worked on implementing a pixel detection algorithm based on given algorithm from the professor

###### -CT1 worked on finishing the image upload to the server as a blob and png

###### -CEO & CTO made sure we can display arrows to the slaves from the master via the google console.

All: 3 Hours
